`cl-mediawiki-v` is a client-side API to access Wiki servers built on MediaWiki engine. Basically it lets to develop bots for Wikipedia/Wikimedia projects.

This is a fork of the [cl-mediawiki](https://github.com/AccelerationNet/cl-mediawiki) library developed by AccelerationNet. This fork, unlike original, uses Json as the data exchange format with the server.

The `util` directory has some basic tool built using this library.
